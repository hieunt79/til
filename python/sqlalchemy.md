# Sqlalchemy

In this tutorial, you'll learn to use:
- **Flat files** for data storage
- **SQL** to improve access to persistent data
- **SQLite** for data storage
- **SQLAlchemy** to work with data as Python objects

## Using Flat Files for data storage

A flat file is a file containing data with no internal hierarchy and usually no references to external files. Flat files often use other structures to make it possible for program to parse text.

### Advantages of Flat files

Working with data in flat files is manageable and straightforward to implement.

Many applications can export flat-files versions of the data generated by the file.

### Disadvantages of Flat files 

Large files are hard to manage. Large files are still human-readable, but editing them or looking for data becomes a more difficult task. To change data, must read entire file into memory, then make change, and write the data out to another file.

People that you want to share your data will also need to know about and act on the structures and relationships you've created in the data. They also have to know the programing tools for accessing it.
